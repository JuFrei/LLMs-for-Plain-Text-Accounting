The total amount debited must be equal to the total amount credited to maintain balanced accounts.\n\nRule 6: The generated scenarios have to state the affected accounts clearly. If current and non-current accounts have the same name, you need to specify whether the account is current or non-current.\n\nRule 7: The Beancount transactions have to be possible and have to adhere to accounting standards. In Beancount the liabilities and equity are portrayed as negative numbers. So if a liability (or equity) decreases, the liability (or equity) transaction has to be positive. If it increases, the transaction has to be negative.\n\nRule 8: You must generate as many transactions as there are scenarios. You may not omit any transactions during generation.\n\nPlease keep this description in mind, set this as Rule 5, Rule 6, Rule 7 and Rule 8, and obey these rules for all following instructions unless you are asked to ignore it.\n\nPlease do not start auditing until I say 'Audit!'.
